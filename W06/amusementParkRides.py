        Rules:
        1)  No one under 36 inches may ever ride, either by themselves or with another rider.
        2)  Normally, two riders sit in the car together. A single rider can only ride if they are at least 18 years old and are at least 62 inches tall.
        3)  If there are two riders and one of them is at least 18 years old, they may ride together.
        Requirements:
        1)  Prompt the user for the age and height of the first person. Then, ask whether there is a second rider, and if so, ask for their age and height.
        2)  Handle the case of a single rider.
        3)  Finish implementing the basic rules.

        inputs:  an integer to represent the age of the first rider from the user to the question "What is the rider's age? "
                 a floating point decimal to represent the height of the first rider from the user to the question "How tall is the the rider in inches?"
                 a boolean to represent if there is a second rider from the user to the question "Is there a second rider? "
                 if there is a second rider an integer to represent the age of the second rider from the user to the question "What is the second rider's age? "
                 if there is a second rider a floating point decimal to represent the height of the second rider from the user to the question "How tall is the 
                    the second rider in inches?"
        process:  if-elif-else statements to determine if the riders may ride the ride.
        output:  "Sorry you may not ride this ride." for no or "Welcome to the ride.  Please be safe and have fun!" for yes
    version 1.1:
    date:  10/19/2022
        inputs:  if either is 12 to 17 years old a boolean to represent if they have a golden passport from the user to the question "Do you have a golden passport? "
        process:  if-elif-else statements to determine the additional cases
    Challenge:
        Requirements:
        1)  If there are two riders, but neither one is at least 18 years old, they may still ride as long as they are both at least 12 years old and at least 52
                inches tall.
        2)  If a person is age 12â€“17, ask if that person has a golden passport. If they do, they should be treated as if they were 18 years old for the sake of
                all rules. (Don't forget to apply this to the single rider case.)
        3)  If there are two riders, but neither one is at least 18 years old, they may still ride if one rider is at least 16 years old and the other is at least
                14. (Keep in mind that the first rider may be the younger of the two or they may be the older of the two.)
